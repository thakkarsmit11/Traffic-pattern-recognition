# Traffic-pattern-recognition
Mining patterns in large transport-related data benefits many transport
applications, such as long-term strategic planning and short-term traffic
control and management. This project provides a new systematic
framework to cluster time series data considering distribution and
geometric distance. For this, a novel distribution distance measure that
captures the similarity/dissimilarity across time series data which is
symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality conditions is proposed. A
cluster evaluation indicator called Cluster Heterogeneity Index (CHI) is
defined to cluster the time series. As proof of the concept, the
framework is applied to real data from a Brisbane arterial corridor, and it
shows promising results.

The overall framework to reveal traffic patterns is as shown in figure below:

The patterns revealed using the proposed approch can be well identified and understood using the below heatmaps:
